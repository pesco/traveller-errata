* Format of the files: *
UTF-8 plain text, Unix line endings (a single linefeed character, ASCII 0Ah,
at the end of each line, including the last line of the file). Maximum line
length 80 characters. Each errata item is introduced by one of the above
abbreviations at the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by one TAB
character (ASCII 09h), followed by a page specification ("p. X" or "pp. X-Y"),
another TAB character, and free form errata text. Text may continue on further
lines by indenting them two or more TAB characters. Items are ordered by book
and page number.

lwb.html	from lwb.txt (via convert.sh)

* Auxiliary files: *
Makefile	run 'make' to generate HTML output

  u001.zip	URW U001, a free replacement for Univers (body font)
  classico.zip	URW Classico, a free replacement for Optima (title font)
  *.ttf		font files extracted from the above

* Known issues: *
The Makefile uses a convenient OpenBSD extension to generate the HTML title
tag from the input file name. On Linux (i.e. with GNU make), the title will
always be "Errata", as opposed to "LWB Errata", for instance. Other BSDs may
yield different results, yet. Considered low-impact.
