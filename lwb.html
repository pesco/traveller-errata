</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>pp. 30, 33</td><td>
		The listing "Combat Procedure" on p. 30 does not state
		clearly whether all targets and attacks should be declared
		before any throws are made. The same applies to the paragraph
		"Basic Required Throw" on p. 33, second sentence: "He or she
		must then make a basic throw...". Is the word "then" here
		meant to imply that the throw is made immediately after the
		target is declared? This would give an advantage in that attacks
		could be declared based on knowledge of prior throws despite
		all attacks conceptually occuring at the same time.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 33</td><td>
		First paragraph: In what order should the characters (player
		and non-player) state their movement status?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 33</td><td>
		Section "Combat Resolution": "A series of throws, in which
		each participating individual capable of making a combat throw
		makes one, is called a combat round". Does every individual
		have to attack if they can? (Presume no.)
		Suggestion: "... in which each individual capable of doing so is
		allowed to make a combat throw, ..."
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 34</td><td>
		It is very hard to tell directly from the text who or what
		determines the particular characteristic that a regular (i.e.
		not "first blood") wound should be applied to. (Presume
		defender's choice.)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 34</td><td>
		The words "wound", "wounds", "hits", and "points" are used
		without clear definition, making it hard to tell from the text 
		that "the first wound received" refers to (presume) the sum
		total of damage thrown.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 34</td><td>
		"As a result, first blood may immediately incapacitate or even
		kill": The sentence confusingly seems to imply that somehow
		otherwise the wound could not incapacitate or kill.
		Suggestion: Replace "immediately" with "easily".
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 34</td><td>
		"Once a characteristic has been reduced to zero, further
		points...": The text does not make it clear how to determine
		the next characteristic that "overflow" damage should apply
		to. (Presume the same way as the first.)
		Suggestion: "... further points must be applied to other
		characteristics determined in the same way." Move the sentence
		to the beginning of the paragraph to bring it closer to the
		mentions of how to determine the affected characteristic.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 34</td><td>
		"Round fractions against the character" (presume down):
		Replace with "Round fractions down"? NB: LWB p. 155 states
		"round down" (only) in the context of characters who never go
		unconscious.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 35</td><td>
		Section "Expertise", paragraph "Parrying": (a long gun) "is
		treated as a brawling weapon (a cudgel)". However, Cudgels are
		classified as polearms, not brawling weapons in section
		"Combat Equipment" on p. 37. Should the parenthesis on p. 35
		be changed to "(a club)"? Otherwise it is unclear which skill
		to use (Brawling or Cudgel). NB, 1977 edition: "... uses the
		gun as a brawling weapon (as a club, for example)."
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 36</td><td>
		Section "Morale": "+1 if the party is a military unit". Does
		this mean a unit in active military service? Can a "party of
		adventurers" (first sentence) be such a military unit? If not,
		should "of adventurers" be removed from the first sentence?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB1</td><td>p. 36</td><td>
		Section "Morale": "-2 if the leader is killed". Does this
		modifier apply only when killed or also when unconscious?
		While the wording is clear in itself, brevity, surrounding
		mentions of "casualties (unconscious or dead)", and the
		following questions confuse it.
		(a) Do "leader present" bonuses still apply when the leader is
		unconscious? (Presume no.)
		(b) Do bonuses of a new leader apply immediately (in the same
		round)? (Presume yes.)
		(c) Does killing an unconscious leader who has already been
		replaced still incur -2 and if so for how long? (Presume no.)
		Suggestion: "+1 if [any] leader (leader skill) is present [and
		conscious]; ...; -2 if the [current] leader is killed (...)"
</td></tr>

		Game Turn Sequence, Native Player Turn: This section is word
		for word identical to Intruder Player Turn with only the roles

		Suggestion: Add one sentence below "Native Player Turn" and

		Maneuver/evade: The wording "take the fraction of pilot skill

		drop it along with all others?

		round down".
</td></tr>
<tr><td>LWB2</td><td>p. 39</td><td>
		Auto/evade: It is unclear how exactly A/e is "similar" to M/e
		and what "at a lower level" means. Is it similar in that it
		allows maneuvering, i.e. acceleration during the movement
		phase? (Presume no.) Can it be used without the maneuver
		program? (Presume yes.) Or does the wording "use of the
		maneuver drive as required" under M/e mean to imply that
		evasion requires the M-drive and therefore Maneuver?
		Suggestion: Switch the order of paragraphs, explaining
		Auto/evade first and Maneuver/evade as an extension of it.
		"Auto/evade is a program which automatically produces minor
		movement for a ship (independent of the maneuver program),
		thus reducing the chances of the ship being hit by laser fire;
		it allows a defensive DM against laser fire of -2.
		Maneuver/evade is a series of six programs that are similar to
		auto/evade, but perform at a higher level. Each has a DM based
		on pilot expertise (take the indicated fraction of pilot skill
		and round down). In addition, these programs allow normal use
		of the maneuver drive, in lieu of the maneuver program."
